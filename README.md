Pico Projects
=============

This repository contains some projects I have built for the Raspberry Pi Pico.

NTP Clock
---------

This MicroPython project turns a Rasberry Pi Pico W and a Pimoroni Pico Display Pack 2.0 into a clock that automatically sets itself using the Network Time Protocol (NTP).
